Building CUDPP              {#building-cudpp}
==============

CUDPP has currently been tested on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.  
See the [Release Notes](@ref release-notes) for release-specific platform support.

Initial checkout 

$ git clone https://github.com/cudpp/cudpp.git

With CUDPP 2.2, we've added suffix_array which has dependencies on [cub](http://nvlabs.github.io/cub/) and [moderngpu](http://nvlabs.github.io/moderngpu/) libraries. They are added as submodules and you will need to pull them in using the following two commands in the cudpp/ root directory:

$ git submodule init

$ git submodule update

Thrust Dependency           {#build-thrust}
=================

Starting with release 2.0, CUDPP uses the [Thrust](http://thrust.github.io) 
library for the implementation of cudppRadixSort(). Thrust is included with 
the CUDA Toolkit, so if you are using CUDA 4.0 or later, you need to do 
nothing else. If you are using an earlier version of CUDA however, you will 
need to download the Thrust source distribution and install it in your 
CUDA/include path before building CUDPP

Building CUDPP using CMake   {#build-cmake}
==========================

CUDPP 2.0 uses CMake for cross-platform builds.  Follow the instructions
[on the CUDPP Wiki](https://github.com/cudpp/cudpp/wiki/BuildingCUDPPwithCMake)
to build CUDPP.
 
Warnings                      {#warnings}
========

You may see warnings during compilation of the form "warning: Double is not
supported.  Demoting to float".  You can safely disregard these warnings.
They are generated by the CUDA compiler when kernels that are specialized
for multiple data types are compiled for CUDA targets that do not support 
double precision floating point.
